# HundredCards

Hello and thank you for reviewing my code! :D

## Requirements

1. [node v18+](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.12.0)

2. If you are on Windows, you may need to set your Execution Policy on scripts to run commands in VS Code (or other IDE's). In this case, run this command in any powershell: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

3. Follow the instuctions [here to install the Angular CLI](https://v17.angular.io/cli)

## First build

## Development server

Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server that will automatically launch in a browser tab. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
